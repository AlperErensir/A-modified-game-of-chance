This is a repetitive heads or tails game with a method that the winning chance is almost  100% in total.

The user starts by putting a small amount of his/her money. If the outcome is loss, user adds the lost amount to the first amount and replays and so on. The graphs and
final outcome arrays shows that it is %100 win in the end since the final matrix is higher than 0. (In any fair 50/50 chance game total winnings would be 0 after enough many
games).
